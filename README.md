# Generative Adverserial Networks
Goal will be to train two networks on MNIST data.  One network will try to see if data comes from MNIST while the other network tries to generate images that look like MNIST


## Generator
See the stand-alone genrator notebook

## Discriminator
See the stand-alone discriminator notebook

## GAN
See GAN notebook for the combined generator and discriminator models trained in altering manner

## Linear GAN
The Linear GAN notebook shows a simple case of using a GAN to generate data that falls on a line.

## Helper functions
The myHelper.py file contains helper code for getting the MNIST images.
